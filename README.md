**Your video never leaves your machine.** Hosted tools like Luma and Polycam upload your footage to their servers; Splat Local reconstructs it on the device in front of you. Walk through a space once, get a 3D scene you can fly through forever — no account, no API keys, no CUDA.

Two ways to run it:

| | [Browser creator](https://michael-l-i.github.io/splat-local/create/) | [Native pipeline](#quickstart) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs on | any desktop Chrome / Edge with WebGPU | Apple Silicon Mac |
| Install | none — open the page | `./setup.sh` |
| Quality | experimental, lower resolution | COLMAP poses + Metal-native Brush training |
| Output | `.ply` + `.spz` | full-resolution `.ply` + `.spz`, live training preview |

<sub>An 11 s phone-style walkthrough → a splat you can fly through with WASD/arrow keys. 166 frames, COLMAP poses, 18k training steps — **13 m 22 s end to end** on an M5 Pro MacBook. (The GIFs themselves were rendered from an earlier 30k-step run of the same scene, before the step count was cut; the cut costs nothing measurable — see ² below.)

**[Fly through that scene in your browser →](https://michael-l-i.github.io/splat-local/)** — the same viewer this app ships, running on the reconstruction above. It also [opens your own splat files](https://michael-l-i.github.io/splat-local/viewer.html) (`.ply`, `.spz`, `.sog`, `.splat`, `.ksplat`), locally.

## Why

- **Private by construction.** Poses, training, and the viewer all run on your machine — in a browser tab or on your Mac. There is no server to upload to, no API keys, no CUDA required.
- **You watch it build.** Training checkpoints stream straight into the browser viewer, so the scene sharpens from fog into a real space in real time instead of a progress bar.
- **Quality that holds up.** COLMAP-grade poses + a Metal-native trainer that matches CUDA gsplat output, not a lightweight approximation.

## How it works

```
video ──▶ sharp frames ──▶ camera poses ──▶ splat training ──▶ export
          (ffmpeg +        (COLMAP, or       (Brush: Metal-      (splat-transform:
           sharp-frames)    Depth Anything 3  native 3DGS w/      .ply/.spz archive
                            on MPS)           MCMC + mip AA)      + .sog for the viewer)
```

- **Poses**: [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io) (`pycolmap`) with sequential matching + loop detection — best quality. Mapping runs on [GLOMAP](https://lpanaf.github.io/eccv24_glomap/)'s global solver, which is 1.2–2.0x faster than incremental mapping, with an automatic quality-gated fallback to the incremental mapper (see [Pose mapper](#pose-mapper)). Optional experimental backend: [Depth Anything 3](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Depth-Anything-3) running on Apple's MPS — much faster, slightly lower fidelity.
- **Training**: [Brush](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush) — a Rust/Metal Gaussian-splat trainer that matches CUDA gsplat quality (MCMC densification, Mip-Splatting antialiasing, optional LPIPS loss). It exports `.ply` checkpoints throughout training, which the UI streams into a live [Spark](https://sparkjs.dev) viewer. The stream carries SH-truncated copies — dropping the SH bands above degree 1 sheds 36 of a checkpoint's 59 float properties, so previews are 2.6× smaller (a late checkpoint is ~45 MB instead of ~115 MB) and 2.6× cheaper to parse. The full-SH scene lands on screen the moment training ends.
- **Export**: two artifact families, split on purpose. The **archive** you download (`scene.ply`, `scene.spz`) is full resolution with SH3 and only NaN/degenerate gaussians dropped — no quality decisions applied. The **view** artifact (`scene-view.sog`) is the same scene with near-transparent splats filtered out and Morton-reordered, which is what the browser loads. Half the splats in a typical scene are nearly invisible but still cost fill rate, so filtering them cuts overdraw ~22% without touching what you keep.
- **Everything runs on your Mac.** No cloud, no CUDA. (The [browser creator](browser/README.md) is a separate, smaller pipeline with the same rule: everything runs in the tab.)

## Quickstart

```bash
./setup.sh        # installs ffmpeg/uv if missing, syncs Python env, fetches/builds Brush
./run.sh          # serves http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

No Mac, or nothing to install? The [browser creator](https://michael-l-i.github.io/splat-local/create/)
([source](browser/README.md)) runs video decoding, a small camera solver and Brush
training entirely in desktop Chrome/Edge. It is experimental and lower-resolution,
not a replacement for the native pipeline's reconstruction quality.

Upload a video, pick a preset, watch it build. Presets:

| Preset  | Frames | Res  | Steps | Poses    | Training   | Total             |
|---------|--------|------|-------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Preview | 100    | 1536 | 10k   | ~1 min   | ~7 min     | ~8 min ¹          |
| High    | 200    | 2048 | 18k   | 2–10 min | ~11 min    | **~14 min** ²     |
| Max     | 250    | 2560 | 45k   | 10–20 min| ~35–50 min | ~45 min – 1.2 h ¹ |

<sub>Measured on an M5 Pro MacBook Pro (18-core, 48 GB unified memory).</sub>

<sub>² **High is the measured row**, end to end: 166 frames at 2048 px, 18k steps → 11 s frame selection + 2 m 18 s COLMAP + 10 m 53 s training = **13 m 22 s**. The demo GIFs above are from the same scene at the old 30k setting, which took 24 m 42 s — 30k was cut to 18k because held-out PSNR stops moving once densification stops, at no measurable quality cost ([docs/step-count.md](docs/step-count.md)).</sub>

<sub>¹ **Preview and Max are estimates, not measurements**, and the step rate is not a constant you can extrapolate from. Per-step cost rises with splat count, and splats keep growing until `growth_stop` — so the same scene trained at 2048 px averaged 22.6 steps/s over a 30k run but 27.6 steps/s over an 18k one, because the longer run spent half its life at full splat count. Max is the softest number in the table: 45k steps at 2560 px with LPIPS loss enabled, none of which the measured run exercised. Its range brackets a flat extrapolation at the low end and the LPIPS/resolution penalty at the high end.</sub>

**Pose time varies a lot with the scene.** COLMAP scales superlinearly with frame count and how hard the footage is to match — two runs here took 2 m 18 s at 166 frames and 10 m 1 s at 201 frames. Training is far more predictable, but it is not linear in step count: a run that spends more of its life past `growth_stop` carries a bigger splat set for longer and averages a lower rate.

### Pose mapper

Mapping is the expensive part of the pose stage — 80% of it at 165 frames, 71% at 200. It runs
GLOMAP's global solver by default, then checks the result and automatically falls back to the
incremental mapper if it does not hold up:

| Frames | Incremental | GLOMAP + gate | Speedup | Mapping step alone |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|--------------------|
| 165    | 2 m 55 s    | **1 m 47 s**  | 1.64x   | 139.8 s → 70.6 s (1.98x) |
| 200    | 7 m 32 s    | **6 m 11 s**  | 1.22x   | 320.6 s → 238.9 s (1.34x) |

How much you save depends on the scene: the global solver's cost grows much more slowly than the
incremental one's, but so does the share of the stage it can address — feature extraction and
matching are untouched, and on the 200-frame scene they are already 28% of the total.

```bash
SPLAT_MAPPER=incremental ./run.sh   # off: incremental mapper only, exactly as before
SPLAT_MAPPER=glomap      ./run.sh   # forced: global mapper, fail instead of falling back
SPLAT_MAPPER=auto        ./run.sh   # default: global mapper, gated, auto-fallback
```

Why the gate exists, what it checks, and the held-out-view PSNR behind the default:
[docs/pose-mapper.md](docs/pose-mapper.md).

## Capture tips (quality lives and dies here)

- Move **slowly** in an orbit/arc with lots of overlap; end near where you started (loop closure).
- Lock exposure/white balance if you can; 4K 60 fps gives the frame picker more sharp frames.
- Avoid moving subjects, whip pans, and textureless walls/sky-only shots.

## Notes

- Optional DA3 pose backend: `uv sync --group da3` (Python 3.12 venv, installs PyTorch). Uses `depth-anything/DA3-LARGE` by default; override with `DA3_MODEL=depth-anything/DA3-SMALL ./run.sh` for speed.
- Optional `.spz` archive + `.sog` viewer export uses `npx @playcanvas/splat-transform` (needs Node). Without it you still get the raw `scene.ply`.
- Optional **mesh output** (choose *Mesh* or *Both* at upload): a textured `.obj` from Apple's Object Capture, lined up with the splat so it can serve as collision geometry. Needs macOS 12+ on Apple Silicon and the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) to build `tools/objcap`. Photogrammetry can't reconstruct glass; the splat can.
- Why not LingBot-World? It's an image→video *world generator* (28B params, CUDA-only, no 3D output) — the wrong tool for video→3D reconstruction, and it can't run on a Mac. This project uses the reconstruction stack that modern world-model papers themselves use for geometry.

## Privacy

Your video, frames and splats are processed on your device and never sent anywhere — in the browser creator, the viewer and the native app alike. There are no accounts and no runtime CDN dependencies.

The hosted [demo site](https://michael-l-i.github.io/splat-local/) counts page views with [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com): no cookies, no personal data, just the page, the referrer and any `?ref=` tag on the link. The script is added at deploy time by [`site/analytics.sh`](site/analytics.sh), so the native app, local builds and forks carry no analytics at all.
